## Who am I?

My name is Aina Abad and I'm 30 years old. I grew up in a village called Sant Sadurní d'Anoia, famous for being the # 1 cava producer worldwide. Later, I moved to Vilafranca del Penedès, the capital of the region, for 4 years, and then I lived in Barcelona city for 1 year and a half. Now I completely changed scenarios, since I'm living in **Sort**, a town in the pyrenees surrounded by high mountains.

## Why am I taking this course?

I have spent my whole life in **scientific academic research**. First, I did my **bachelor degree in biotechnology**. Afterwards, my **master and my PhD in biomedicine**, specifically bioengineering *in vitro* models of the intestinal epithelium tissue. After finishing my doctoral degree, I did a postdoc of one year in the same lab to finish up some undergoing projects, Now, after all these years in between benches, I have come to the conclusion that I don't like the lifestyle that goes along with this career field, including living in a city. Becoming a **data scientist** would facilitate me to work from wherever I wish.

## What is my previous experience with coding?

Although flexibility is currently the main reason why I want to become a data scientist, *I have always been interested in coding*. During my bachelor degree, I had the opportunity to use **R** for statistics and data visualization. Later, during my PhD, I did some basic **MatLab** codes, for instance to track cells over time and plot their trajectories from a common origin.

## Fun facts about me

As you might have guessed, I am not a huge fan of cities, quite the opposite. Indeed, I moved to Sort because living in Barcelona - and working in a lab - made me feel anxious and stressed continuously. The truth is that I have always loved being outdoors in the nature surrounded by mountains practising sports such as:
- climbing
- running
- hiking
- backcountry skiing
